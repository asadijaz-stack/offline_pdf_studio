## Security & Privacy
This app is designed with a privacy-first approach. Because all operations are local, sensitive files are never uploaded to any cloud service. 

Additionally, the repository is configured to exclude sensitive keys (`key.properties`, `.keystore`, `.env`, `google-services.json`) from version control to prevent accidental leaks.
